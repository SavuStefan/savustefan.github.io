    <h3>From The Shadows - A small Text Based RPG</h3>

    <p>Stealth games are my favourite. I like that it offers an alternative way to complete a mission or level, which makes it more challenging and fun. Some of my favourite games are Dishonored, Thief series and Hitman. The game's universe that I based my little text adventure is Thief, with predominant elements from Thief: Deadly Shadows.
        <br>
        <br>
        "From the shadow" references the way you should be playing stealth games; stay in the shadows, keep a low profile, don't make a lot of noise. Our "Thief" has been all his life living in the streets, pickpocketing mobility and stealing from people's houses. But that's changes when a Keeper shows at the Clocktower... </p>
    <br>
    <p>My main goal when creating this game was keeping in simple in terms of code and structure, so that's why you will encounter mostly simple "if"/"if else" statements, combined with prompt() and alert() methods (Image 1). The only downside is that I can't customize the alert box. For the game to begin, I created a function called Start() tied to the button "Start the Adventure". Then I created some basic RPG characters with a few stats and "perks" to make the game more fun and interesting (Image 2). Later, when I gain new knowledge, I will remaster it.</p>
    <p>The story was inspired from the Thief: Deadly Shadows's plot; the focus on the struggle to bring Balance to the corrupted Keeper Order through activation or destruction of the Final Glyph.</p>

    <h4>"In the First Age..." - The Introduction Audio</h4>
    <p>It was creating using a free text-to-speech software. The characters voice is Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy aka Regis, a very powerful higher vampire from books and video game "The Witcher".</p>

    <p>The pop-up you encounter in the "How to play" was created using a custom JavaScript popup box called <a href="https://sweetalert2.github.io/">SweetAlert2</a> and animated using <a href="https://animate.style/">Animate.css</a>. The image was taken from  <a href="https://craftpix.net/">Craftpix website</a>.</p>
