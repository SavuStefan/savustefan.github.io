        <h3>My portfolio website</h3>

        <p>Called "Ground Zero", this was my first big project I created, representing, also, the cornerstone of my future career as a web developer. It was developed using just HTML and CSS and will be constantly updated with interesting features as I learn along the way, using JavaScript too.
            <br>
            <br>
            Without having a Computer Science Degree, I want to show my future employers that I have knowledge of web development by creating cool projects and showcase them on my website - think of this as my experience in the field.</p>
            <br>

            <div class="img-container">
                <img src="images/Gridsetup.png" alt="grid-setup">
                <img src="images/Gridcolumn.png" alt="grid-column">
                <img src="images/AboutGrid.png" alt="about-grid">
            </div>

            <br>
            <p>The website is mainly composed of 2 components (grid and flexbox) created in such a way as to be reused. This ensures a fluid way of working, responsiveness and accessibility.
            <br>
            <br>
            As the main colors i chose blue because it's my favourite color and yellow fully compliments her.
            <br>
            <br>
            Fun fact: As a passionate gamer, I tend name my projects after my favourite video games. "Ground Zero" is inspired after one of the game from the franchise Metal Gear (Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes).</p>


        <h4>My logo</h4>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img style="width: 50%" src="images/logo.png" alt="logo">
        </div>

        <p>The logo has a simple design which represents my name "Adrian". The chose those colors because I want to be in tune with the colors present on the site.</p>
